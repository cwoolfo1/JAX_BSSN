Demos
=====

The supported physical examples are gauge wave, linear wave, spherical Cartoon
puncture, and an electromagnetic pp-wave packet. Each demo owns its coordinates,
initial data, parameters, and run loop.

Install demo support first:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install -e ".[demos]"

Electromagnetic pp-wave packet
-----------------------------

The ``EM_waves`` demo evolves the exact Einstein--Maxwell plane-wave family
of Harte and Drivas (arXiv:1202.0540v3) in Rosen coordinates. It uses the
production first-order Maxwell/BSSN stepper on a plane-symmetric Cartesian
grid, with prescribed lapse and shift and exact boundary data.

.. code-block:: bash

   python demos/EM_waves/run.py
   python demos/EM_waves/make_movies.py --input demos/EM_waves/output
   python demos/EM_waves/validate.py

The default packet crosses from z=-2 to z=2 over t=0 to t=4. Movies compare
the numerical EM fields and gravitational response with the exact solution.
The validator checks the continuum equations independently and measures
spatial and temporal convergence. The reference scale factor obeys
``a'' = -f^2 a``; the demo rejects intervals where ``a < 0.5`` to keep
evolution away from Rosen coordinate focusing.

Gauge wave
----------

The gauge-wave demo evolves the analytic positive-x harmonic gauge wave on a
periodic uniform grid with harmonic slicing and fixed zero shift. It reports
RMS errors against the analytic solution at the final time.

.. code-block:: bash

   python demos/gravitational_waves/gauge_wave.py

The default configuration uses ``grid_size=60``, amplitude ``0.1``, wavelength
``1``, CFL ``1``, and one wavelength of evolution.

Linear wave with FMR
--------------------

The linear-wave demo evolves a plus-polarized wave through a configurable
centered chain of 2:1 refinement patches (three total levels by default). It
uses synchronized RK4 and reports composite diagnostics using the finest
available value at each physical location.

.. code-block:: bash

   python demos/gravitational_waves/linear_wave.py

The default run writes the VisIt multiblock collection
``demos/gravitational_waves/output/linear_wave_fmr.visit``. Open that file in VisIt to
load the root and fine patches together. The collection spatially aligns the
overlapping blocks; it does not remove root cells covered by the fine patch or
encode native AMR nesting.

Each patch is also an independent file-based openPMD series, with per-patch
``.pmd`` helpers for ParaView. ``grid_size`` must be divisible by four so 
the centered inclusive patch bounds land on coarse vertices. The demo rejects 
a final normalized coarse or fine RMS wave error at or above five percent.



Spherical Cartoon puncture
--------------------------

The Cartoon puncture demo evolves time-symmetric Schwarzschild data
on ``Nr`` positive half-cell radii with four parity ghosts. Each RK stage
reconstructs a temporary Cartesian support grid, so the installed Cartesian
BSSN equations remain the single equation implementation.

.. code-block:: bash

   python demos/spherically_symmetric_cartoon_puncture/cartoon_puncture.py

The production defaults reproduce the comparison configuration:
``Nr=2000``, ``rmax=100M``, CFL ``0.2``, final time ``100M``, and 500 output
intervals. ``run_cartoon_puncture`` accepts smaller values for smoke runs.

Output is written under ``output/`` as ``cartoon_puncture.h5`` and
``constraint_l2.txt``. The openPMD series contains the complete reflected
``2*Nr x 1 x 1`` axis, including all BSSN tensor components and Hamiltonian and
momentum constraints. Constraint norms use only independent positive radii and
exclude the four outer stencil-affected samples.
